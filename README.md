## 🎯 How It Works
## Architecture Overview

The app is organized into two main services:

1. Backend API Service (Node + Express)
   Handles business logic, CRUD operations, summaries/aggregations, and data validation. Persists data in MongoDB.

2. Frontend Web App (React + Tailwind)
   Provides the user interface: dashboard, transactions pages, charts, filters, and reports. Communicates with the backend via REST.

### Workflow Process

##1. Transaction Creation
- Users add income or expense entries with `amount`, `category`, `note`, and `date`.
- Data is validated on the client and server before storage.

## 2. Categorization & Filtering
- Transactions are stored with their type and category.
- Users can filter by date range, category, and type to inspect specific periods.

## 3. Visualization & Insights
- The frontend queries summary endpoints to render charts (line/bar/pie).
- The dashboard shows Total Balance, Total Income, Total Expenses, and Top Categories.

#### 4. History & Management
- Users view a historical list of transactions and can edit or delete entries.
- Optional features like export (CSV/Excel) can be added later.
